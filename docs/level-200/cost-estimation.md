## 5-Year Total Cost of Ownership

### TCO Calculation Example

```
SCENARIO: Mid-Size Edge RAG Deployment
DEPLOYMENT: Single Azure Local site, 8 nodes + 2 GPU

CAPEX (Year 0)
──────────────
Hardware:           $250,000
Software/Tools:      $15,000
Professional Svc:   $100,000
                    ────────
CAPEX Total:        $365,000

OPEX YEAR 1
──────────
Licensing:           $40,000
Personnel (2.5 FTE): $313,000
Operations:          $100,000
Maintenance:         $20,000
DR/Backup:           $30,000
Contingency (10%):   $50,300
                    ────────
OPEX Year 1:        $553,300

5-YEAR PROJECTION
─────────────────
Year 0 (Setup):      $365,000 (CAPEX only)
Year 1:              $553,300
Year 2:              $568,900 (OPEX + 3% inflation)
Year 3:              $585,800 (OPEX + 3% inflation)
Year 4:              $603,000 (OPEX + 3% inflation)
Year 5:              $621,000 (OPEX + 3% inflation)

TOTAL 5-YEAR TCO:    $3,296,900

Per Query Baseline:
  Annual queries: 30M (estimated)
  5-year queries: 150M
  Cost per query: $3,296,900 / 150M = $0.022/query

COMPARISON: Cloud API Alternative
──────────────────────────────────
API Cost: $0.001 per 100 tokens
Avg tokens per query: 150
Per query cost: 150 × $0.00001 = $0.0015/query

Annual cloud cost: 30M × $0.0015 = $45,000/year
5-year cloud cost: $225,000

Edge vs. Cloud Decision Point:
  5-year edge TCO:    $3,296,900
  5-year cloud TCO:   $225,000
  
  Edge breaks even at: 150M+ queries (vs. 30M current)
  BUT: Edge provides sovereignty, compliance, low latency
  
  ROI comparison (intangibles):
  - Data sovereignty: Priceless for regulated data
  - Latency improvement: 400ms → 100ms (4x faster)
  - Compliance capability: Enables regulatory requirement
  - Vendor independence: Reduces lock-in risk
```

### 3-Year vs. 5-Year vs. 10-Year TCO

```
SCENARIO: Compare different investment horizons

                    3-Year TCO    5-Year TCO    10-Year TCO
                    ──────────────────────────────────────
Year 0 (CAPEX):      $365,000     $365,000      $365,000
Years 1-3 (OPEX):   $1,707,900   $1,707,900    $1,707,900
Years 4-5 (OPEX):        -       $1,189,800    $1,189,800
Years 6-10 (OPEX):        -            -       $2,996,100
                    ──────────────────────────────────────
Total TCO:          $2,072,900   $3,262,700    $6,258,800

Cost per Query (assuming 30M/year growth):
  Year 3:  $2,072,900 / 90M queries = $0.023/query
  Year 5:  $3,262,700 / 150M queries = $0.022/query
  Year 10: $6,258,800 / 300M queries = $0.021/query

INSIGHT: Unit cost stabilizes after Year 3, improving slightly
with scale. 5-year horizon is "sweet spot" for ROI analysis.

```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

```
STRATEGY 1: Shared Infrastructure (Save 20-30%)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Current Model: Single workload cluster
Optimization: Host multiple workloads on same cluster

Example:
  ├─ RAG system: 40% of cluster
  ├─ Analytics workload: 30% of cluster
  ├─ Transactional DB: 20% of cluster
  └─ Development/testing: 10% of cluster
  
  Savings:
  ├─ Hardware: 1 cluster vs. 4 = 75% reduction in CAPEX
  ├─ Personnel: 1 ops team vs. 4 = 75% reduction in people
  ├─ Licensing: Shared across workloads = 50% reduction
  
  Result: $365K → $100K CAPEX, $500K → $200K OPEX

STRATEGY 2: Phased Deployment (Save 40-50% Year 1)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current: Full 8-node deployment from start
Optimization: Start with 3 nodes, grow to 8 over 18 months

Timeline:
  ├─ Year 0: 3 nodes ($100K hardware)
  ├─ Year 1 Q2: Add 3 nodes ($100K hardware)
  ├─ Year 1 Q4: Add 2 nodes ($65K hardware)
  └─ Total: $265K spread across 18 months

  Cash flow benefit:
  ├─ Immediate outlay: $100K vs. $250K
  ├─ Validate ROI before full commitment
  ├─ Plan for growth based on actual usage
  
  Savings in Year 1: -$150K (-58% Year 1 capex)
  Drawback: Smaller initial capacity (mitigated with cloud burst)

STRATEGY 3: Managed Services Partnership (Save 30-50%)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current: In-house operations team (2.5 FTE)
Optimization: Partner for 24/7 managed services

Models:
  ├─ Option A: Microsoft support + managed partner
  ├─ Option B: System integrator handles ops (contract)
  ├─ Option C: Hybrid - critical functions in-house, rest managed
  
  Cost comparison:
  ├─ In-house: 2.5 FTE × $135K = $337K/year
  ├─ Full managed: 24/7 NOC, $250K/year
  ├─ Hybrid managed: 1 FTE in-house + $120K/year managed
  
  Savings: -$87K/year (-26%) with full managed option
  Risk: Less control, potential outsourcer dependency

STRATEGY 4: Co-investment & Partner Programs (Save 20-40%)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current: Customer funds entire project
Optimization: Microsoft/Partner co-invest for innovation

Programs:
  ├─ Microsoft Innovation Fund: Co-investment up to 50%
  ├─ Partner incentive programs: Hardware discounts 15-25%
  ├─ Proof of concept credits: $10K-50K in cloud/software
  
  Typical result:
  ├─ $365K project with 30% partner co-investment
  ├─ Customer funds: $255K
  ├─ Partner funds: $110K
  
  Customer net savings: -$110K (-30%)
  Trade-off: Expanded scope, customer becomes reference

STRATEGY 5: Licensing Model Optimization (Save 10-15%)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current: License per server/per node
Optimization: Negotiate volume licensing, bundles

Options:
  ├─ Option A: Hybrid benefit (use existing licenses)
  ├─ Option B: EA/Enterprise agreements (volume discount)
  ├─ Option C: 3-year prepaid commitment (15-20% discount)
  
  Potential savings:
  ├─ $40K annual licensing → $35K (-12.5%)
  ├─ 5-year savings: $25K
  
  Best approach: Combine with other strategies
```

## Cloud vs. Edge Financial Comparison

### Side-by-Side TCO Analysis

```
WORKLOAD: 30M queries/year, average 150 response tokens

CLOUD API APPROACH (e.g., Azure OpenAI Service)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Cost Model: $0.001 per 100 tokens
  30M queries × 150 tokens × $0.00001 = $45K/year

5-Year Cost:
  Year 0-5: $45K × 5 = $225,000

Advantages:
  ✓ Zero capital investment
  ✓ No operations team needed
  ✓ Automatic scaling
  ✓ Built-in redundancy
  ✓ Latest models always available

Disadvantages:
  ✗ Ongoing per-query costs (never-ending)
  ✗ Vendor lock-in
  ✗ Network latency (200-500ms)
  ✗ Data sovereignty concerns
  ✗ Limited customization


EDGE DEPLOYMENT APPROACH
────────────────────────
Capital Investment (Year 0): $365K
Operating Costs (Years 1-5): $500K/year average

5-Year TCO:
  $365K + ($500K × 5) = $2,865,000

Advantages:
  ✓ Data sovereignty and compliance
  ✓ Low latency (100ms)
  ✓ Unlimited queries (no per-query cost)
  ✓ Full customization and control
  ✓ No vendor lock-in

Disadvantages:
  ✗ High upfront investment
  ✗ Operations team required
  ✗ Manual scaling
  ✗ Maintenance responsibility
  ✗ Model updates require management


FINANCIAL DECISION MATRIX
─────────────────────────
Query Volume (Annual)  | Cloud Advantage | Edge Advantage
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<5M queries            | $22K vs. $100K  | Cloud wins (82% cheaper)
10M queries            | $45K vs. $150K  | Cloud wins (70% cheaper)
20M queries            | $90K vs. $200K  | Cloud wins (55% cheaper)
30M queries            | $135K vs. $250K | Cloud wins (45% cheaper)
50M queries            | $225K vs. $350K | Cloud wins (36% cheaper)
100M queries           | $450K vs. $500K | Edge wins (11% cheaper)
200M queries           | $900K vs. $550K | Edge wins (39% cheaper)
500M queries           | $2.25M vs. $700K| Edge wins (69% cheaper)

BREAK-EVEN POINT: ~90M queries/year
  At this volume, 5-year costs are approximately equal


HYBRID APPROACH (Optimal for Many Organizations)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Strategy: Edge for core workload, cloud for burst/overflow

Model:
  ├─ Edge capacity: 50M queries/year ($500K OPEX)
  ├─ Cloud burst: 20M queries/year ($90K OPEX)
  ├─ Cloud total: Annual $590K for 70M query capacity
  ├─ Reserve capacity: 50% headroom on edge
  
  Benefits:
  ├─ Sovereignty for core workloads (edge)
  ├─ Unlimited scaling (cloud burst)
  ├─ Cost control (pay for what you use)
  ├─ Flexibility (shift workloads as needed)
  
  Recommendation: Start with edge for base load,
  keep cloud APIs available for dynamic scaling

## ROI & Payback Analysis

### ROI Calculation Template

```
FINANCIAL MODEL: Microsoft Sovereign Cloud Edge Solution

BENEFITS (Quantifiable, Annual)
────────────────────────────────
1. Reduced Cloud API Costs
   Current: Using cloud APIs for 30M queries/year
   Cost: $45K/year
   Savings with edge: -$45K/year

2. Operational Efficiency Gains
   Current: Manual data processing (2 FTE)
   Reduction: 30% automation → 0.6 FTE saved
   Savings: 0.6 × $135K = $81K/year

3. Compliance Capability Value
   Current: Unable to process regulated data
   Benefit: Process additional $2M revenue stream
   At 10% margin: $200K benefit/year
   Probability: 60% likely in Year 2 = $120K

4. Reduced Latency Benefits
   Current: 500ms response latency
   Edge: 100ms (5x improvement)
   Productivity gain: 2% more efficient workflows
   Savings: Across 200 employees = $45K/year

5. Reduced Data Transfer Costs
   Current: All queries traverse internet
   Transfer cost: 30M × 0.5MB × $0.05/GB = $750K/year
   Edge: Local processing, saves $750K/year

TOTAL ANNUAL BENEFITS: $45K + $81K + $120K + $45K + $750K = $1,041K

COSTS (Annual, Recurring)
──────────────────────────
Hardware (amortized): $250K / 5 years = $50K
Personnel (2.5 FTE): $337K
Operations: $100K
Licensing/support: $40K
Other: $20K

TOTAL ANNUAL COSTS: $547K

YEAR 1 ANALYSIS
───────────────
Benefits:        $1,041K (conservative estimate)
Less: Costs:     -$547K
Less: CAPEX:     -$365K (implementation)
Net Benefit Y1:  $129K

ROI Year 1:      $129K / $365K = 35% ROI in Year 1
Payback Period:  $365K / $1,041K = 3.5 months

YEARS 2-5 (Steady State)
────────────────────────
Annual net benefit: $1,041K - $547K = $494K/year
Cumulative 5-year: $494K × 4 = $1,976K (years 2-5)

5-YEAR SUMMARY
──────────────
Year 1 net:       $129K
Years 2-5 net:    $1,976K
TOTAL 5-YEAR ROI: $2,105K / $365K CAPEX = 576% 5-yr ROI
                  = 77% annual ROI (compound)
```

### Break-Even Analysis

```
BREAK-EVEN CALCULATION
══════════════════════
Total 5-Year Investment: $2,865K
Required Annual Benefit: $2,865K / 5 = $573K/year

Can customer achieve $573K annual benefit?

Revenue Impact Benefits:
  ├─ New revenue from sovereign compliance: $300-500K? (need validation)
  ├─ Cost savings vs. cloud APIs: $45-300K? (depends on volume)
  ├─ Operational efficiency: $50-100K? (depends on implementation)
  ├─ Latency improvements: $20-50K? (indirect)
  
  Subtotal: $415-950K potential annual benefit

VERDICT: Break-even achievable if customer can capture
any combination of revenue opportunity + cost savings

MOST LIKELY SCENARIO:
  • Cloud API cost avoidance: $100K
  • Operational efficiency: $75K
  • Compliance revenue enablement: $200K (conservative)
  • Total captured benefit: $375K/year
  
  Annual ROI: ($375K - $547K costs) / $365K capex = -47%
  
  This looks like a loss! But:
  - Year 1 heavy with implementation costs
  - Year 2+ have lower opex (~$500K vs. $547K)
  - Compliance benefits are "intangible" but critical
  - Payback still achievable in 3-4 years
  
  RECOMMENDATION: Focus on compliance + governance value,
  not pure cost savings ROI
