## Operational Patterns

### RAG System Health Model

```

─────────────────────
Queries      Vector Search    LLM Generation    User Feedback
    │              │                │                 │
    ├─→ <50ms      ├─→ >95% recall  ├─→ <500ms      ├─→ 4.5/5.0
    ├─→ <1% errors ├─→ <1% failures ├─→ <2% errors  ├─→ Factual
    └─→ 100% avail └─→ 100% data    └─→ Coherent    └─→ Relevant

Monitoring Alert Thresholds:
  - Query latency p95 > 200ms → Warning
  - Query latency p95 > 500ms → Critical
  - Vector recall < 90% → Warning
  - LLM generation errors > 5% → Critical
  - Vector search failures > 1% → Critical
```

### Deployment Topology Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Active-Active (Multi-Region)

```
Region 1 (Primary)          Region 2 (Secondary)
┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│ LLM Service (3x)    │     │ LLM Service (3x)    │
│ Vector DB (3x)      │◄───►│ Vector DB (3x)      │
│ Data Connectors     │     │ Data Connectors     │
└─────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
       ↑                              ↑
    80% users                    20% users
       (local latency)           (cross-region fallback)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Active in both regions
- Users served locally
- Automatic failover
- Async replication

#### Pattern 2: Active-Passive (Standby)

```
Active (Primary)            Passive (Standby)
┌──────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────┐
│ Full deployment  │       │ Scaled down      │
│ 100% serving     │◄─────►│ 25% capacity     │
│ Traffic: 100%    │ Sync  │ Traffic: 0%      │
└──────────────────┘       └──────────────────┘
     Real Users            Standby Ready

Failover (Automatic):
  1. Primary health check fails (3 consecutive)
  2. DNS updated to Standby
  3. Standby scales to 100%
  4. Users reconnected
  5. Time: <10 seconds
```

**Characteristics:**
- Cost-efficient standby
- Reduced primary load
- RPO: Minutes (async replication)
- RTO: <10 seconds

## Quality Metrics & Evaluation

### RAG Quality Assessment

#### 1. Retrieval Quality

**Metric: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**

```
Query: "What is the current Azure Local pricing?"
Retrieved documents:
  1. "Azure Local pricing as of Oct 2025: $..."    ✓ Relevant
  2. "Azure Stack HCI pricing history"              ⚠ Partially
  3. "Azure VM pricing comparison"                  ✗ Not relevant

MRR = 1/1 = 1.0 (perfect, found relevant at position 1)

Typical Goals:
  MRR > 0.90 (excellent)
  MRR > 0.75 (good)
  MRR > 0.50 (acceptable)
```

**Metric: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**

```
Relevance scores (0-2):
  Position 1: Score 2 (perfect)   DCG₁ = 2 / log₂(2) = 2
  Position 2: Score 1 (partial)   DCG₂ = 1 / log₂(3) = 0.63
  Position 3: Score 0 (irrelevant) DCG₃ = 0

NDCG@5 = (2 + 0.63) / IdealDCG = 0.88

Typical Goals:
  NDCG > 0.85 (excellent)
  NDCG > 0.70 (acceptable)
```

#### 2. Generation Quality

**Hallucination Detection:**

```
Query: "What's the latest Azure Local hardware spec?"
Retrieved Context: "Azure Local hardware: 2x Intel Xeon, 384GB RAM, 10x NVMe"
Generated Response: "Azure Local requires 4x Intel Xeon, 768GB RAM, 20x NVMe"

Issues:
  - Doubles CPU cores (not in context)
  - Doubles memory (not in context)
  - Doubles storage (not in context)
  
Hallucination Rate: 100% of response details

Detection Method:
  1. Extract facts from response
  2. Check if facts appear in context
  3. Calculate % not supported by context
  
Metric: Hallucination Rate
  Target: <2% of responses
  Alert: >5% triggers investigation
```

**Factual Accuracy:**

```
Human Evaluation:
  - Does response answer the question? Yes/No
  - Are facts grounded in context? Yes/No
  - Is response logically coherent? Yes/No
  - Would user be satisfied? Yes/No

Score: 0-4 (number of yes answers)
Target: 3.5+ average score
Evaluation: Random sampling (100/1000 queries weekly)
```

#### 3. User Satisfaction

**CSAT (Customer Satisfaction):**

```
Post-query feedback:
  1. Helpful (5 ⭐)
  2. Somewhat helpful (4 ⭐)
  3. Neutral (3 ⭐)
  4. Not helpful (2 ⭐)
  5. Misleading (1 ⭐)

CSAT = (# of 4-5 ratings / # of responses) × 100

Targets by use case:
  - General Q&A: >85% CSAT
  - Technical docs: >90% CSAT
  - Customer support: >95% CSAT
```

## Observability & Logging

### Distributed Tracing

**Trace a single query through the system:**

```
User Query: "What's the best Azure Arc practice?"
Trace ID: abc-123-xyz

Timeline:
  00ms: Query arrives
  05ms: Tokenization + Embedding generation
       [Vector Service] 50ms latency
  55ms: Vector search (retrieve top 10 documents)
       [Vector DB] 50ms latency
       Result: 10 docs, recall=0.96
  105ms: LLM context assembly
         Input: 8 docs (900 tokens)
  120ms: LLM inference
         [LLM Service] 350ms latency
         Output: 150 tokens
  470ms: Post-processing
  480ms: Total response time

Visualization (Jaeger/Zipkin):
  Query
    ├─ Embedding (5ms)
    ├─ Vector Search (50ms)
    │  └─ Reranking (15ms)
    ├─ LLM Inference (350ms)
    │  ├─ Tokenization (5ms)
    │  ├─ Forward Pass (330ms)
    │  └─ De-tokenization (15ms)
    └─ Formatting (10ms)
```

### Centralized Logging

**Log aggregation and analysis:**

```
Log Levels:
  DEBUG:   Low-level details (100+ logs/sec)
  INFO:    Normal operations (10 logs/sec)
  WARNING: Unexpected but recoverable (1 log/min)
  ERROR:   Failures requiring attention (1 log/hour)
  CRITICAL: System-threatening issues (alert immediately)

Log Format:
  timestamp=2024-10-21T10:30:45.123Z
  level=INFO
  service=llm-inference
  trace_id=abc-123-xyz
  query_id=q-456
  duration_ms=350
  event="LLM inference completed"
  tokens_generated=150
  model_version=llama-7b-v1.2

Aggregation:
  - Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana (ELK)
  - Loki (lightweight, log-based metrics)
  - Splunk (enterprise)
  
Analysis:
  - Search: "duration_ms > 1000" (slow queries)
  - Alert: "error_count > 10/minute"
  - Dashboard: Error trends over time
```

## Incident Response

### SLO & Error Budgets

```
Service Level Objective (SLO):
  Availability: 99.9% (43 minutes downtime/month)
  Latency p95: <200ms
  Error rate: <0.5%

Error Budget:
  Total: 100% - 99.9% = 0.1% (43 minutes/month)
  
  Week 1: Error budget used = 0.06% (used 26 min)
  Week 2: Error budget used = 0.02% (used 8 min)
  Week 3: Available = 0.02% (9 minutes remaining)
  Week 4: Cannot deploy (no buffer for failures)

Decision:
  Week 1-2: Deploy confidently
  Week 3:   Deploy only critical fixes
  Week 4:   Freeze deployments, focus on stability
```

### Incident Severity Levels

```
Level 1 (Critical):
  - Service completely unavailable
  - Affecting >50% of users
  - Data loss or corruption
  - Response time: 5 minutes
  - Resolution time: 1 hour

Level 2 (High):
  - Significant degradation (>2s latency)
  - Affecting 10-50% of users
  - Incorrect responses
  - Response time: 15 minutes
  - Resolution time: 4 hours

Level 3 (Medium):
  - Minor issues, workarounds exist
  - Affecting <10% of users
  - Response time: 1 hour
  - Resolution time: 8 hours

Level 4 (Low):
  - Documentation, cosmetic issues
  - No user impact
  - Response time: 24 hours
  - Resolution time: 1 week
```

### Incident Playbook

**Example: High Latency Incident**

```
Trigger: Latency p95 > 500ms for 5 minutes

Step 1: Immediate Assessment (2 minutes)
  □ Confirm alert via dashboard
  □ Check affected regions/services
  □ Verify not scheduled maintenance
  
Step 2: Triage (3 minutes)
  □ Is it LLM service? Check GPU memory, queue
  □ Is it vector search? Check memory, load
  □ Is it network? Check latency between services
  
Step 3: Investigation (5-10 minutes)
  Sample Findings:
    - GPU memory 95% (high)
    - LLM service has 50 queued requests
    - Vector search is healthy
    
Step 4: Mitigation (2 minutes)
  Option A: Scale up LLM service
    kubectl scale deployment llm-service --replicas=5
    Expected improvement: 20-30% latency reduction
    
  Option B: Clear queue, reject new requests temporarily
    kubectl set env deployment/ingress QUEUE_LIMIT=50
    
  Option C: Switch to smaller model
    kubectl set env deployment/llm-service MODEL=phi-3-3b

Step 5: Verification (2 minutes)
  □ Latency p95 returning to baseline
  □ Error rate remains normal
  □ No user complaints
  
Step 6: Root Cause Analysis (Post-incident)
  □ Why did load spike?
  □ Should autoscaling have kicked in?
  □ Need to adjust scaling thresholds?
```

## Best Practices

### Operational Checklist

```
Daily:
  ☐ Review error rate and latency trends
  ☐ Check data freshness (embeddings, indices)
  ☐ Monitor resource utilization
  ☐ Review critical logs

Weekly:
  ☐ Analyze quality metrics (CSAT, accuracy)
  ☐ Review incident reports
  ☐ Test failover procedures
  ☐ Capacity planning analysis

Monthly:
  ☐ Performance optimization review
  ☐ Cost analysis and optimization
  ☐ Model update readiness check
  ☐ Security and compliance audit

Quarterly:
  ☐ Disaster recovery drill
  ☐ Scaling capacity review

  ☐ Customer feedback review
```

### Alerting Strategy

```
Alert Fatigue Prevention:
  - Don't alert on every single metric
  - Focus on user-impacting metrics
  - Use derived conditions (e.g., latency + errors)
  
Sample Alert Rules:
  ✓ DO alert: Availability < 99.5%
  ✓ DO alert: Error rate > 2%
  ✓ DO alert: p95 latency > 500ms for 10 min
  ✗ DON'T: CPU > 50% (might be normal)
  ✗ DON'T: Any single error (false positives)
```
