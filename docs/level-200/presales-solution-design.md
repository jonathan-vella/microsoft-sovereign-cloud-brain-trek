## Solution Sizing Framework

### Workload Assessment Matrix

```
Workload Type | Data Volume | Queries/Day | Users | SLA Req | Arch Pattern
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RAG System    | 100K docs   | 10K         | 50    | 99.9%   | Active-Active
Database      | 50GB        | 100K        | 500   | 99.95%  | HA Cluster
Analytics     | 500GB+      | 1K batch    | 20    | 99%     | Hub-Spoke
Monitoring    | 1TB/month   | Streaming   | 10    | 95%     | Centralized
Cache Layer   | 10GB        | 1M ops/sec  | 100   | 99.9%   | Local Replica
```

### Hardware Sizing Calculator

```
STEP 1: Determine Workload Requirements
─────────────────────────────────────────
Input: Concurrent users, queries/sec, data volume
Calculate: Peak load, memory needed, storage

Example:
  - 100 concurrent users
  - 500 queries/second peak
  - 1 million document vectors
  - Average response latency: <200ms

STEP 2: Map to Azure Local Hardware
─────────────────────────────────────────
Input: Workload requirements
Output: Recommended cluster configuration

Calculation:
  LLM Service: 100 concurrent × 500 QPS = 5 GPU nodes (16GB VRAM each)
  Vector DB: 1M vectors × 2KB per vector = ~2GB memory (1 node + replica)
  Total: 5 GPU nodes + 2 data nodes + 2 management = 9 nodes

STEP 3: Validate Against Hardware Constraints
─────────────────────────────────────────────
CPU: 9 nodes × 32 cores = 288 cores ✓
Memory: 9 nodes × 384GB = 3.5TB ✓
Storage: 50TB total available ✓
Network: 25Gbps fabric ✓

STEP 4: Add Redundancy & Growth Buffer
──────────────────────────────────────
Redundancy: 2x (HA replicas)
Growth buffer: 30% (capacity planning)
Year 1: 11 nodes
Year 2: 14 nodes
Year 3: 18 nodes
```

### Sizing Questions by Component

#### LLM Inference Sizing

```
Question: What's your concurrent user requirement?
- Light: <50 users → Single T4 GPU (16GB)
- Medium: 50-500 users → 3-5 T4 GPUs
- Heavy: 500-5000 users → 8-16 A100 GPUs
- Enterprise: 5000+ users → Multi-node GPU cluster

Question: What inference performance is needed?
- Response latency <300ms → Quantized model (INT4) + batching
- Response latency <500ms → Quantized model (INT8)
- Response latency <1s → Non-quantized model
- Batch processing → Throughput optimization (larger batches)

Recommendation: Mistral 7B INT4 on T4 GPU serves 500 QPS @ 200ms latency
```

#### Vector Database Sizing

```
Question: How many documents will you index?
- <1M vectors → Single-node Chroma or FAISS
- 1-10M vectors → Single-node Qdrant or Weaviate
- 10-100M vectors → Multi-node Milvus with sharding
- >100M vectors → Distributed deployment with replication

Question: What's your QPS requirement?
- <100 QPS → Single-node (standard config)
- 100-1000 QPS → Replicated single-node
- 1000-10000 QPS → Multi-shard with load balancing
- >10000 QPS → Enterprise multi-region deployment

Recommendation: 1M vectors + 500 QPS = 2-node Qdrant with replication
```

#### Storage Sizing

```
Calculation:
  Embeddings: 1M vectors × 1536 dims × 4 bytes (FP32) = ~6GB
             (or ~1.5GB with INT8 quantization)
  Cache layer: 10GB for hot data
  Backup: 3x storage for 3 copies
  Growth buffer: 30% for 12 months

  Total = (6GB + 10GB) × 3 × 1.3 = ~62GB minimum
  Recommended: 100GB SSD allocation
```

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We're not ready for edge AI yet"

**Root Concern:** Risk, capability gap, timing misalignment

**Effective Response:**
```
"I understand the concern. Many of our customers started with a
proof of concept to validate readiness. We can:

1. Start with a limited POC (50 users, 1 workload)
2. Use our training and enablement to build your team's skills
3. Microsoft provides 24/7 support during implementation
4. We can phase deployment: 3-6 months to production, not 12+ months

Your competitors are already deploying edge AI. Starting a POC now
positions you to be ready when the business urgently needs it.
What if we scheduled a 2-week assessment to validate your readiness?"
```

### "Cloud APIs are cheaper"

**Root Concern:** Misconception about TCO, concerns about long-term costs

**Effective Response:**
```
"Let's run the numbers together:

Cloud API approach:
- 100 million queries/year × 150 tokens avg
- 15 billion tokens/year × $0.00001 = $150K/year
- 5-year cost: $750K

Edge approach:
- Hardware: $200K (one-time)
- Operations & licenses: ~$426K/year
- 5-year cost: $2.33M

BUT you're comparing apples to oranges:
- Cloud APIs are stateless queries only (no integration, no context)
- Edge gives you proprietary data integration, full control, sovereignty
- At scale (>30M queries/year), edge is 40% cheaper per query

Plus: Sovereignty, data residency, compliance, low latency.

What's your expected query volume in year 1?"
```

### "We can't afford the hardware investment"

**Root Concern:** Budget constraints, capital allocation challenges

**Effective Response:**
```
"I hear you. Let's explore financing options:

1. Phased deployment: Start with 2-3 nodes, grow to full 9-node
   cluster over 18 months. Spreads capex across budgets.

2. Leasing model: Many partners offer hardware leasing at
   ~$15-20K/month vs. $170K upfront. Check your capex policy.

3. Shared infrastructure: Co-host with non-production workloads,
   development environments. Reduces initial hardware needs by 30-40%.

4. Partner co-investment: We have partner programs where innovation
   credits can offset hardware costs.

5. Hybrid approach: Start on-premises with smaller cluster, extend
   to cloud during peaks. Get benefits immediately.

What budget cycle are you working with, and would phased
deployment help you get approval?"
```

### "We have concerns about security"

**Root Concern:** Data protection, compliance, operational security

**Effective Response:**
```
"Security is paramount. Here's our approach:

1. Data sovereignty: Keep all data on-premises, never transmitted to cloud
2. Encryption: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
3. Access control: RBAC + MFA + audit logging
4. Compliance: Built-in GDPR, FedRAMP, HIPAA support
5. Monitoring: 24/7 threat detection and incident response
6. Supply chain: Trusted hardware partners, secure boot

Most customers find edge IMPROVES security because:
- No cloud data transfer
- Complete visibility and control
- Disconnected operation capability
- Local incident response

Let me show you our security architecture. What are your
specific compliance requirements?"
```

### "We're invested in [competitor] already"

**Root Concern:** Switching costs, existing relationships, integration concerns

**Effective Response:**
```
"I understand the existing investment. Azure can work alongside
existing systems:

1. Integration: Azure Arc connects servers from any cloud/platform
2. Hybrid: Run workloads on both Azure and your current platform
3. Migration: Phased migration path if desired (3-6 months typical)
4. Interoperability: APIs and standards-based (Kubernetes, etc.)

Many customers run hybrid environments:
- Critical workloads stay on existing platform
- New AI/edge workloads on Azure
- Shared management from Azure Arc

This gives you best of both without rip-and-replace risk.

What specific workloads are you considering for edge?
Would a hybrid approach work better for you?"
```
