Azure Local's architecture can be understood through four interconnected layers, each designed to work together seamlessly.

### Hardware Layer

The foundation of Azure Local starts with carefully selected, enterprise-grade hardware:

**CPU Architecture:**
- Modern multi-core processors (3rd Gen Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC)
- NUMA architecture for optimal memory access
- CPU core allocation split between control plane and compute workloads
- Typically 48-64 cores per node for production deployments
- Hyper-threading enabled for increased VM density

**Memory Architecture:**
- DDR5 memory for latest hardware generation (older systems support DDR4)
- Typical configurations: 256 GB - 1 TB per node
- ECC memory required for data integrity
- Memory divided between host OS and VM workloads
- Proper NUMA alignment critical for performance

**Storage Subsystem:**
- NVMe drives for ultra-low latency cache
- SSD capacity for primary storage (typically 800GB - 2TB per drive)
- HDD archive tier for long-term retention (optional, 2-10TB per drive)
- Minimum of 4 drives per node for redundancy
- PCIe lanes configured for maximum throughput

**Network Adapters:**
- Multiple 25Gbps or 100Gbps adapters (depending on workload)
- Typically 2-4 adapters per node for segmentation
- One management adapter (out-of-band connectivity)
- Storage adapters supporting RDMA (iWARP or RoCE)
- Cluster communication adapters for high-speed inter-node traffic

### Virtualization Layer

The hypervisor layer provides isolated, secure environments for workloads:

**Hyper-V Architecture:**
- Type 1 hypervisor for maximum efficiency
- Partition 0 (management) runs Windows Server 2022 or 2025
- Partition N (child partitions) run customer workloads
- Virtual switching for flexible network topologies
- Integration with Storage Spaces Direct (S2D)

**VM Networking:**
- Virtual switching supporting various network modes
- Hyper-V network virtualization (HNVE) for multi-tenant isolation
- Virtual NIC pass-through for high-performance requirements
- RDMA passthrough for data-intensive workloads

**Storage Virtualization:**
- Virtual disks (VHDX format) for VM storage
- Pass-through disks for specialized workloads
- Shared disks for cluster-aware applications
- Snapshot capabilities for backup and recovery

### Azure Local System Layer

The platform software provides management and orchestration:

**Control Plane:**
- Azure Local system services running on all nodes
- Distributed fault-tolerant design
- Automatic health monitoring and remediation
- REST API for programmatic access
- PowerShell for automation

**Data Plane:**
- Compute workload execution
- Storage I/O processing
- Network traffic handling
- Completely isolated from control plane for resilience

**Storage Spaces Direct (S2D):**
- Distributed storage providing shared pool
- Automatic fault tolerance (2-way mirror, 3-way mirror, parity)
- Cache tier management (RAM â†’ SSD â†’ HDD)
- Capacity distribution across cluster nodes

### Management and Orchestration Layer

Enterprise-grade management capabilities:

**Azure Local System UI:**

- Single pane of glass for multi-site deployments

---

## Network Architecture

Network design is critical for Azure Local performance and reliability. Most production deployments use a converged network architecture with logical segmentation through VLANs.

### Network Segments

**Management Network:**
- Out-of-band management connectivity
- Separate from data traffic
- Bandwidth: 1 Gbps per node typically sufficient
- Low latency requirements (< 1ms)
- Dedicated gateway for secure access

**Storage Network:**
- High-speed fabric for S2D communication
- RDMA-capable (iWARP or RoCE preferred)
- Bandwidth: 25 Gbps or 100 Gbps per node
- Ultra-low latency critical (< 0.5ms)
- Redundant paths required

**Cluster Network:**
- Inter-node cluster heartbeat
- Bandwidth: 10 Gbps minimum, 25 Gbps recommended
- Latency requirements: < 5ms acceptable
- Must have redundancy

**Customer/Workload Network:**
- Virtual machine traffic to external clients
- Bandwidth requirements depend on workload
- Multiple VLANs for tenant isolation
- Quality of Service (QoS) for traffic management

### Network Design Patterns

**Converged Networking (Recommended):**
- Single set of physical adapters with logical segmentation
- More cost-effective than separate adapters
- Requires careful QoS configuration
- Works well for most deployments

**Separate Physical Networks:**
- Dedicated adapters for each network type
- Higher resilience and performance isolation
- More expensive but clearer operational model
- Often used in large enterprise deployments

### Bandwidth Calculations

For a 3-node cluster with 500 GB storage and typical workloads:
- Management: 50 Mbps average, 500 Mbps during updates
- Storage: 3-5 Gbps depending on workload type
- Cluster: 100 Mbps average (spikes during failures)
- Workload: Depends on customer requirements (1-10+ Gbps)

**Rule of thumb:** Size management links at 1-2 Gbps per node, storage links at 25 Gbps minimum, cluster links at 10-25 Gbps.

### VLAN Strategy

```
Physical Port 1 (Mgmt) â†’ VLAN 100 (Management)
Physical Port 2 (Converged) â†’ VLAN 200 (Storage) + VLAN 300 (Cluster) + VLAN 400-420 (Customer VMs)
Physical Port 3 (Backup) â†’ VLAN 200 (Storage backup path)
```

## Storage Architecture

### Storage Pool Architecture

Azure Local creates a distributed storage pool across all cluster nodes:

**Single Storage Pool Model:**
- All nodes participate in shared storage pool
- Automatic distribution of data across nodes
- Provides resilience to node failures
- Typical capacity: 2-20 TB per node

**Multi-Pool Model (Advanced):**
- Separate pools for different SLA tiers
- Useful for performance segregation
- Rare in smaller deployments

### Cache Hierarchy

Storage performance depends on intelligent cache management:

**Tier 1 - RAM Cache:**
- 10-20 GB reserved per node for hot data
- Lowest latency (< 1 microsecond)
- Survives node restart but not power loss
- Managed automatically

**Tier 2 - NVMe/SSD Cache:**
- Read-write cache in NVMe (if present) or SSD
- Read-only cache in SSD (if NVMe absent)
- Latency: 100-200 microseconds
- Persistent across power cycles
- 10-50x larger than RAM cache

**Tier 3 - Capacity Tier:**
- SSD primary storage (1-2 TB per node)
- HDD archive tier (optional, 2-10 TB per node)
- Latency: 1-10 milliseconds
- All data stored here eventually

### Storage Resilience Models

**2-Way Mirror:**
- Data stored on exactly 2 nodes
- Survives 1 node failure
- Overhead: 50% (1 TB data = 2 TB storage)
- Minimum 2 nodes required
- Recommended for non-critical workloads

**3-Way Mirror:**
- Data stored on 3 nodes
- Survives 2 simultaneous node failures
- Overhead: 67% (1 TB data = 3 TB storage)
- Minimum 3 nodes required
- Recommended for production critical

**Parity (Dual Parity):**
- Data + parity stored using RAID-like algorithm
- Survives 2 failures with lower overhead
- Overhead: 50% (1 TB data = 2 TB storage equivalent)
- Lower performance than mirrors
- Recommended for archival data

### Capacity Planning Example

For 3-node cluster with 2 TB SSD per node + 1 TB NVMe cache:

```
Raw storage: 3 nodes Ã— 2 TB = 6 TB
With 3-way mirror: 6 TB Ã· 3 = 2 TB usable
Available for VMs: ~1.8 TB (accounting for OS and system)
```

## High Availability & Disaster Recovery

> **ðŸ“Š Visual Reference: Asset 22 - High-Availability Architecture**  
> *Placeholder - See docs/assets/images/README.md#asset-22*  
> Diagram showing 3-node and 4-node cluster topologies, quorum options (disk, file share, cloud witness), storage replication modes, and failover scenarios with RTO/RPO annotations.

### Failure Domains

Resilience design requires understanding failure modes:

**Node Failure:**
- Single node stops responding
- Workloads migrate to surviving nodes
- Storage automatically recovers from mirrors
- Typical recovery time: 5-15 minutes

**Network Segment Failure:**
- Network partition between cluster nodes
- Quorum mechanism prevents split-brain
- Nodes without quorum shut down
- Manual intervention typically required

**Storage Failure:**
- Loss of individual drive
- Replaced by spare or new drive
- Data automatically reconstructed
- Temporary performance impact

**Entire Site Failure:**
- Complete data center loss
- Requires multi-site setup
- Manual failover or automatic replication
- RTO/RPO depends on configuration

### Quorum Strategies

**Node Quorum (2 or 3 nodes):**
- Majority of nodes decides cluster health
- 3-node cluster needs 2 healthy nodes
- No external witness required
- Automatic decision making

**File Share Witness (2-node clusters):**
- External file share provides tiebreaker
- Allows automatic failover in 2-node setup
- Requires management infrastructure
- Cloud witness available for cloud-based deployments

**Cloud Witness:**
- Azure Storage account provides witness
- No on-premises infrastructure needed
- Latency consideration for quorum decisions
- Suitable for hybrid/cloud scenarios

### Failover Mechanisms

**Automatic VM Failover:**
- VM on failed node restarts on survivor
- Typically transparent to clients
- Storage state preserved through mirrors
- Network may briefly interrupt

**Storage Rebuild:**
- Failed node's storage mirrors rebuilt
- Automatic process starting immediately
- Significant I/O activity during rebuild
- Requires spare capacity on surviving nodes

**Application-Aware Failover:**
- Cluster-aware applications (SQL Server, etc.)
- Database-level recovery
- Requires application support
- More complex but optimized behavior

### Backup and Restore

**VM-Level Backup:**
- Snapshot-based backups
- App-consistent or crash-consistent
- Stored on separate storage
- Faster recovery for single VM loss

**Cluster-Level Backup:**
- Configuration backup for cluster
- Not substitute for data backup
- Contains cluster settings only
- Used for disaster recovery planning

**Replication-Based DR:**
- Real-time or scheduled replication to secondary site
- Automatic or manual failover
- Various RTO/RPO objectives possible
- Higher cost but near-zero data loss

### RTO/RPO Targets

**Typical Recovery Objectives:**

```
Single Node Failure:
  RTO: 5-15 minutes (automatic)
  RPO: 0 minutes (no data loss with mirrors)

Multi-Node Failure:
  RTO: 30 minutes - hours (depends on recovery strategy)
  RPO: Depends on backup/replication configuration

Complete Site Loss:
  RTO: 1 hour - days (depends on multi-site setup)
  RPO: 1 hour - depends on replication lag
```
