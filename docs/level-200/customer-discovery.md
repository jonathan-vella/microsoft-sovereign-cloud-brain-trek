❌ PITFALL 5: Accepting vague answers
   ✓ SOLUTION: Get specific numbers (latency, throughput, users)

❌ PITFALL 6: Not documenting assumptions
   ✓ SOLUTION: Explicitly call out assumptions and confirm

❌ PITFALL 7: Missing data flow details
   ✓ SOLUTION: Draw diagrams and confirm data movement

❌ PITFALL 8: Underestimating integration complexity
