## Key Concepts

### What is Zero Trust?

**Zero Trust Security Model:** A security approach that assumes no implicit trust and requires continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications before granting access to resources.

**Traditional Perimeter Security (Legacy):**
```
Internet ← Firewall ← Internal Network (Trusted)
          ↓
    Once inside perimeter, access assumed
```

**Zero Trust Model (Modern):**
```
Every Access Request → Identity Verification
                    ↓
                Device Check
                    ↓
                Risk Assessment
                    ↓
                Conditional Access Policies
                    ↓
                    Grant (Limited, Monitored)
```

### Why Zero Trust for Sovereign Clouds?

**1. Enhanced Control:**
- Customer maintains explicit control over all access decisions
- No implicit trust based on network location
- Meets sovereign cloud requirement: "Customer control over access"

**2. Regulatory Alignment:**
- FedRAMP mandates continuous monitoring and verification
- GDPR requires granular access controls for data protection
- HIPAA requires audit trails for all access
- ITAR requires explicit user/device validation

**3. Data Protection:**
- Access tied to business need and risk level
- Sensitive data accessible only with highest verification
- Compliance data stays within sovereign boundary

**4. Operational Independence:**
- Works in disconnected environments (local verification)
- Doesn't depend on cloud provider infrastructure
- Local enforcement of access policies

## The Six Zero Trust Pillars

> **📊 Visual Reference Needed**  
> *Zero Trust Pillars & Framework (Asset 41)*  
> Infographic showing six pillars (Identity, Device, Network, Application, Data, Infrastructure) with icons, descriptions, and key controls for each pillar.  
> **Specification Reference:** See `docs/level-300/VISUAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md` → Asset 41  
> **Source to adapt:** [Zero Trust security model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview)

### Pillar 1: Identity
Verify every user's identity before access. Not based on network location or past authentication.

**Key Controls:**
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Passwordless authentication options
- Conditional Access based on user risk
- Just-in-time (JIT) access elevation

### Pillar 2: Device
Ensure device health and compliance before allowing access to resources.

**Key Controls:**
- Device compliance assessment
- Health attestation
- Device management enrollment
- Conditional Access based on device status

### Pillar 3: Network
Assume external network is untrusted. Implement microsegmentation and monitoring.

**Key Controls:**
- Network microsegmentation
- VPN or SD-WAN enforcement
- Encrypted communications
- Network monitoring and anomaly detection

### Pillar 4: Application
Protect applications with authentication and authorization at application layer.

**Key Controls:**
- Application-level authentication
- API security and validation
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Application monitoring and logging

### Pillar 5: Data
Classify, encrypt, and protect sensitive data. Ensure access is logged and monitored.

**Key Controls:**
- Data classification
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Access logging and audit trails
- Tokenization or redaction

### Pillar 6: Infrastructure
Secure cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and compute resources.

**Key Controls:**
- Infrastructure access controls
- Container security
- Compute resource hardening
- Infrastructure monitoring

### Additional Sovereign Requirements

**Standard Cloud Zero Trust:**
- Baseline security controls
- Cloud provider managed infrastructure
- Regional availability
- Standard compliance frameworks

**Sovereign Cloud Zero Trust:**
- **Data Residency:** All access must occur within sovereign boundary
- **Customer Control:** Explicit customer control over all access policies
- **Government Compliance:** FedRAMP, GDPR, ITAR, or other frameworks
- **Air-Gap Capable:** Can operate in disconnected mode
- **Audit & Transparency:** Complete audit trail accessible to customer
- **Local Enforcement:** Access controls enforced locally, not cloud-dependent

### Compliance Integration

**FedRAMP Requirements:**
- Continuous monitoring of access (AC-2, AC-3)
- Enforcement of user-based controls (AC-4)
- Automated audit logging (AU-2, AU-12)

**GDPR Requirements:**
- Data subject rights (access, deletion, portability)
- Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
- Encryption and pseudonymization
- Access logging for compliance

**HIPAA Requirements:**
- Access controls based on role and need
- Audit controls for all access
- Encryption of healthcare data
- De-identification procedures

**ITAR Requirements:**
- U.S. person verification
- Controlled access to technical data
- Storage within approved regions
- Export control compliance
