# Module 2: Azure Local at Scale - Connected Mode

{: .no_toc }

## Overview

Scale Azure Local deployments across multiple sites while maintaining cloud connectivity. This module covers multi-site architectures, advanced networking, cloud-integrated updates, and cost optimization for production environments.

**Duration:** 4-5 hours  
**Learning Tracks:** Both Sales & Technical  
**Prerequisites:** Level 200 Azure Local completion

## Learning Objectives

### Sales Track

- ✅ Design multi-site scenarios for customers
- ✅ Present scaling economics to stakeholders
- ✅ Differentiate connected vs. disconnected strategies
- ✅ Plan PoC-to-production scaling roadmaps

### Technical Track

- ✅ Design hub-and-spoke and mesh topologies
- ✅ Implement multi-site replication with Azure Site Recovery
- ✅ Optimize network performance for multi-site
- ✅ Manage updates across multiple sites
- ✅ Implement cost optimization strategies

## Module Content

### Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Hub-and-Spoke when:**

- Centralized management priority
- Bandwidth constraints
- < 5 sites
- Acceptable hub latency

**Choose Full Mesh when:**

- High availability critical
- Low latency requirements
- < 4 sites (complexity increases)
- Bandwidth available

**Choose Hybrid when:**

- Mix of requirements
- Scaling > 5 sites
- Flexible connectivity options
- Optimal for sovereignty
