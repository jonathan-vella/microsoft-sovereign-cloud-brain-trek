# Monitoring, Compliance & Operational Excellence
{: .no_toc }

## Overview

This page covers operational aspects of Zero Trust: monitoring, compliance automation, audit logging, and day-to-day operational procedures in sovereign cloud environments.

## Monitoring Strategy

### Continuous Monitoring Requirements

**FedRAMP:** Continuous, automated monitoring with monthly analysis  
**GDPR:** Real-time monitoring of data access; yearly audits  
**HIPAA:** Continuous monitoring with immediate alerting  
**ITAR:** Daily review of controlled data access

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**User Access Metrics:**
- Authentication attempts (success/failure rates)
- MFA challenges (frequency, challenge types)
- Failed access attempts (by user, resource, pattern)
- Unusual access times (outside normal hours)
- Geographic anomalies (impossible travel)

**Device Metrics:**
- Compliance status changes
- Operating system version distribution
- Antimalware/antivirus status
- Encryption status
- Device age and lifecycle

**Network Metrics:**
- VPN/SD-WAN connection patterns
- Connection duration and frequency
- Geographic origin of connections
- Network bandwidth usage
- Anomalous network behavior

**Application Metrics:**
- API call rates (by user, app, resource)
- Error rates by application
- Response times
- Rate limit violations
- Authentication failures at app layer

**Data Access Metrics:**
- Access patterns (normal baseline)
- Large data transfers
- Unusual access times
- Sensitive data access
- Export/download activities

## Compliance Automation

### Automated Audit Logging

**What to Log:**
- All authentication attempts (success/failure)
- All authorization decisions (grant/deny)
- All data access (who, what, when)
- All configuration changes
- All administrative actions

**Log Retention:**
- FedRAMP: 6-12 months minimum, 3 years recommended
- GDPR: 3 years minimum for compliance
- HIPAA: 6 years minimum
- ITAR: 7 years minimum

**Log Security:**
- Logs stored in secure, replicated storage
- Log integrity protection (tamper detection)
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Audit trail for log access itself

### Compliance Reporting

**Monthly Reports:**
- Access activity summary
- Security incidents and responses
- Policy violations
- Configuration changes
- Performance metrics

**Annual Audits:**
- Comprehensive control assessment
- Effectiveness validation
- Gap identification
- Remediation planning

**Incident Response:**
- Immediate notification (24-48 hours)
- Investigation documentation
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation and follow-up

## Operational Procedures

### Access Review Cycles

**Daily:**
- Monitor alerts and anomalies
- Verify high-risk access attempts
- Check for policy violations

**Weekly:**
- Review failed access attempts
- Analyze access patterns
- Update risk assessments

**Monthly:**
- Access entitlement review
- Policy effectiveness assessment
- Compliance status review

**Quarterly:**
- Comprehensive access audit
- Entitlement recertification
- Policy updates and refresh

### Incident Response

**Alert Triggering:**
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Impossible travel detection
- Anomalous data access
- Policy violations
- Compliance violations

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Alert confirmation and severity assessment
2. User/device verification
3. Access pattern review
4. Activity timeline reconstruction
5. Business context verification

**Response Actions:**
- Session termination (if high risk)
- Account lockdown (if compromised)
- Device isolation (if infected)
- Credential reset (if exposed)
- Data access revocation

**Documentation:**
- Incident log entry
- Timeline documentation
- Evidence preservation
- Follow-up actions

## Sovereign-Specific Compliance

### Data Residency Compliance

**Policy:** All identity and access data must stay within sovereign boundary

**Implementation:**
- Identity provider in sovereign boundary
- All policy enforcement local
- Audit logs stored locally
- No data export to cloud

**Verification:**
- Regular audits of data location
- Network flow analysis
- Policy compliance checks
- Customer-visible audit reports

### Customer Control & Transparency

**Policy:** Customer maintains explicit control over access policies

**Implementation:**
- Customer-defined access policies
- Customer approval workflows
- Policy change history (customer visible)
- Access logs available to customer (real-time)

**Verification:**
- Policy audit trail
- Access log audits
- Configuration change tracking
- Customer attestation

### Air-Gap Operational Procedures

**Monitoring Without Cloud:**
- Local monitoring agents collect data
- Periodic export of logs (secure transfer)
- Local analysis and alerting
- Offline compliance validation

**Audit Procedures:**
- Local audit execution (no cloud dependency)
- Offline report generation
- Manual review and approval
- Documentation storage (local)

- AC-3: Access enforcement
- AC-4: Information flow enforcement
- AC-20: Use of external information systems

**Continuous Monitoring (CM-3):**
- Monthly access reviews
- Automated audit logging
- Vulnerability scanning
- Configuration compliance

### GDPR Compliance

**Key Articles:**
- Article 5: Lawful, fair processing; storage limitation
- Article 6: Lawfulness of processing
- Article 32: Security measures
- Article 35: Data Protection Impact Assessment

**Access Control Requirements:**
- Individuals' access to their data
- Data deletion upon request ("right to be forgotten")
- Data portability on request
- Consent verification for processing

### HIPAA Compliance

**Key Rules (45 CFR §164.308):**
- Access controls
- Audit controls
- Integrity controls
- Transmission security

**Access Control Measures:**
- Unique user identification
- Role-based access control
- Automatic logoff after inactivity
- Encryption for all data at rest and in transit

### ITAR Compliance

**Key Requirements (22 CFR Part 120-130):**
