# Module 3: Azure Local at Scale - Disconnected Mode
{: .no_toc }

## Overview

Master air-gapped Azure Local deployments with manual updates, certificate management, and complete operational independence. This module covers the most stringent sovereign cloud scenarios with zero cloud dependency.

**Duration:** 8-10 hours  
**Learning Tracks:** Both Sales & Technical  
**Prerequisites:** Level 200 Azure Local completion

## Key Concepts

### Complete Isolation
- No internet connectivity
- No cloud service dependencies
- All updates manual and offline
- Local problem resolution required

### Operational Complexity
- Manual procedures for updates
- Certificate renewal without automation
- No cloud-based monitoring
- Offline troubleshooting tools

### Regulatory Alignment
- Meets strictest data residency requirements
- No data leaves jurisdiction
- Customer complete operational control
- Audit trails stored locally
