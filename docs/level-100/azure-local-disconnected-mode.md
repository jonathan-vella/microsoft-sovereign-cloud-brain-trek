## Periodic Synchronization Strategy

Even in Disconnected Mode, periodic synchronization can be beneficial when security policies permit.

### Sync Options

**Option 1: Periodic Network Connection**
- Connect to internet/Azure on schedule (e.g., monthly)
- Download updates and telemetry
- Sync configuration changes
- Disconnect after sync complete

**Frequency:**
- Monthly (most common)
- Quarterly (for very restrictive environments)
- On-demand (when specific updates needed)

**Option 2: Air-Gapped Transfer**
- Download updates to external media
- Physical transfer to disconnected environment
- Apply updates locally
- No network connection required

**Process:**
1. Use connected system to download updates
2. Copy to USB drive or portable hard drive
3. Security scan media before import
4. Transfer to disconnected environment
5. Import and apply updates
6. Document transfer in audit log

**Option 3: One-Way Data Diode**
