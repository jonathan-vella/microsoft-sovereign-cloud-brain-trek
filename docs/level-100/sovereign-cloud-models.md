## Overview

Microsoft recognizes that organizations have diverse sovereignty requirements based on their industry, regulatory obligations, and operational needs. To address this spectrum of requirements, Microsoft offers **three distinct sovereign cloud models** that provide varying levels of control, isolation, and compliance capabilities.

These models enable organizations to:

- **Balance sovereignty needs with cloud benefits:** Maintain control while leveraging cloud innovation
- **Meet regulatory requirements:** Comply with local laws and industry-specific regulations
- **Optimize for specific use cases:** Choose the right model based on workload characteristics
- **Scale as needs evolve:** Transition between models as requirements change

### Why Multiple Models Matter

Different organizations have different sovereignty needs:

- A European bank may need data residency guarantees but can operate in a shared infrastructure
- A defense contractor requires physical isolation and no external connectivity
- A government agency needs infrastructure operated by local entities with regional compliance certifications

**No single solution fits all scenarios.** Microsoft's three-model approach provides flexibility while maintaining high security and compliance standards.

#### ❌ Choosing the Wrong Model

**Pitfall:** Selecting model based on perception rather than requirements

**Example:** Choosing Sovereign Private Cloud because "it sounds more secure" when Sovereign Public Cloud meets requirements at lower cost

**How to Avoid:**
- Complete thorough requirements assessment
- Use decision framework systematically
- Consider total cost of ownership
- Prototype/POC before full commitment

---

#### ❌ Underestimating Operational Complexity

**Pitfall:** Assuming on-premises Azure Local is "as easy as cloud"

**Example:** Deploying Azure Local without trained staff or operational procedures

**How to Avoid:**
- Invest in training for operations team
- Start with Connected mode before Disconnected
- Document operational runbooks
- Plan for ongoing maintenance and support

---

#### ❌ Ignoring Network Requirements

**Pitfall:** Not planning for bandwidth, latency, and connectivity needs

**Example:** Deploying Azure Local in Connected mode without sufficient internet bandwidth

**How to Avoid:**
- Assess network requirements for chosen model
- Plan for ExpressRoute if needed
- Consider bandwidth for updates, backups, and monitoring
- Test connectivity and latency before go-live

---

#### ❌ Over-Complicating with Multiple Models

**Pitfall:** Using all three models when one would suffice

**Example:** Deploying Azure Local "just in case" when all requirements can be met in Sovereign Public Cloud

**How to Avoid:**
- Start with simplest model that meets requirements
- Add complexity only when justified
- Consider management overhead of multiple models
- Plan integration and governance strategy

---

#### ❌ Forgetting About Data Egress

**Pitfall:** Not considering data transfer costs and restrictions

**Example:** Regular large data transfers from Sovereign Private Cloud to Azure for analytics

**How to Avoid:**
- Understand data residency vs. data processing requirements
- Plan for data minimization and edge analytics
- Consider costs of data egress in model selection
- Implement data lifecycle policies
