## Common Misconceptions About Arc

### Misconception 1: "Arc Moves Data to Azure"
**Reality:** Arc synchronizes metadata and telemetry, not workload data. Your application data, databases, and files stay on-premises. Only configuration, logs, and metrics are sent to Azure for management purposes.

### Misconception 2: "Arc Requires Continuous Internet Connectivity"
**Reality:** While Arc works best with regular connectivity, it's resilient to temporary outages. Resources continue operating locally. Some features (like policy enforcement) work intermittently.

### Misconception 3: "Arc Only Works with Microsoft Products"
**Reality:** Arc supports many non-Microsoft technologies: Linux servers, any CNCF-certified Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and more. It's designed for heterogeneous environments.

### Misconception 4: "Arc Is Just Another Management Tool"
**Reality:** Arc is a management plane (layer), not a tool. It brings Azure Resource Manager capabilities to any infrastructure, enabling consistent tooling, governance, and services.

### Misconception 5: "Arc Replaces My Existing Tools"
**Reality:** Arc complements existing tools. You can continue using VMware vCenter, Kubernetes tooling, etc. Arc provides an additional layer for Azure-based governance and services.
