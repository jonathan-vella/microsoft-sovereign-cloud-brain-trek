### Memory Requirements

**Minimum:** 128 GB DDR4 ECC  
**Recommended Production:** 384 GB - 1 TB  
**Large Deployments:** 1 TB - 6 TB

**Memory Sizing Formula:**
```
Total Memory = (Base OS + Storage Spaces Direct + VMs + Overhead)

Where:
- Base OS: 8-16 GB per node
- Storage Spaces Direct: 2-4 GB per TB of cache + 1 GB per TB of capacity
- VMs: Sum of VM memory allocations
- Overhead: 20% buffer for spikes
```

**Example Calculation (4-node cluster):**
- Base OS: 12 GB × 4 = 48 GB
- S2D (10 TB cache, 100 TB capacity): 40 GB + 100 GB = 140 GB
- VMs: 200 VMs × 8 GB average = 1,600 GB
- Overhead: 20% = 320 GB
- **Total: 2,108 GB (divide by 4 nodes = 528 GB per node)**

**Memory Type:**
- **DDR4 or DDR5:** ECC (Error-Correcting Code) required

**Capacity-Optimized:**
- 2x NVMe SSD (cache): 800 GB each
- 10-12x SATA HDD (capacity): 12-16 TB each
- **Use Case:** File servers, archives, backup

**Storage Sizing Formula:**
```
Usable Capacity = (Total Raw Capacity × Efficiency Factor × Resiliency Factor)

Efficiency Factors:

Resiliency Factors:
- Two-way mirror: 0.5 (50% efficiency)

- Parity (erasure coding): 0.5-0.8 (depends on configuration)
```

**Example:**
- 4 nodes × 10x 4TB SSD = 160 TB raw
- Two-way mirror: 160 TB × 0.5 = 80 TB usable
- Three-way mirror: 160 TB × 0.33 = 53 TB usable
