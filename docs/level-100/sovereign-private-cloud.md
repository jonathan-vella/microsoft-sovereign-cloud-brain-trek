## What is Sovereign Private Cloud?

**Sovereign Private Cloud** delivers Azure services on dedicated, customer-owned infrastructure, providing the **highest level of sovereignty and control** while maintaining Azure-consistent operations and management. It represents the evolution from traditional on-premises infrastructure to modern hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) with cloud-like capabilities.

### Core Concept

Sovereign Private Cloud brings Azure **to your data**, not your data to Azure. It provides:

- **Physical Isolation:** Dedicated hardware in customer-controlled facilities
- **Operational Independence:** Ability to operate with or without cloud connectivity
- **Local Control:** Customer control over hardware, updates, and operations
- **Azure Consistency:** Same APIs, tools, and management as Azure cloud
- **Flexible Connectivity:** Connected (hybrid) or Disconnected (air-gapped) modes

**Powered By: Azure Local** (formerly Azure Stack HCI)

**Key Principle:** "Azure services anywhere, including completely disconnected"

## Azure Local: Foundation of Sovereign Private Cloud

### What is Azure Local?

**Azure Local** is Microsoft's hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solution that brings Azure services to on-premises or edge locations. It combines:

- **Compute:** Hyper-V virtualization for VMs and containers
- **Storage:** Storage Spaces Direct for software-defined storage
- **Networking:** Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for virtual networks
- **Management:** Azure Arc for cloud-based management (Connected mode) or Windows Admin Center (Disconnected mode)

**Official Definition from Microsoft:**
> "Azure Local is a hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) cluster solution that hosts virtualized Windows and Linux workloads and their storage in a hybrid on-premises environment. Azure Local brings Azure services, cloud-based management, and security to customer datacenters and edge locations." - [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/overview)

- 4-node cluster: $100,000-$140,000
- Networking: $20,000-$50,000 (switches, cables)
- Rack, power, cooling: $10,000-$30,000
- **Total CapEx:** $130,000-$220,000

**Operational Expenditure (OpEx) - Annual:**
- Azure Local subscription: ~$15,000-$25,000/year (for 4-node cluster)
- Hardware support/maintenance: ~$20,000-$30,000/year (20% of hardware cost)
- Power and cooling: ~$5,000-$10,000/year
- IT staff time: Variable (estimate 0.5-1 FTE)
- **Total OpEx:** $40,000-$65,000/year

**5-Year TCO:** $330,000-$545,000

**TCO Comparison (4-Node Cluster):**
