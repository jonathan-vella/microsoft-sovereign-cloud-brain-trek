## ROI and Business Value

### Quantifiable Benefits

**Time Savings:**
- 50-80% reduction in information search time
- 40-60% faster document review
- 30-50% improvement in response time

**Cost Savings:**
- Reduced support escalations
- Lower training costs
- Fewer redundant efforts

**Revenue Growth:**
- Faster time to market
- Better customer experience
- Improved decision quality

### Calculating ROI

**Example: Customer Support**

**Before RAG:**
- 1000 tickets/day
- Average handling time: 15 minutes
- Cost per agent hour: $30
- Daily cost: 1000 * 0.25 * $30 = $7,500

**After RAG:**
- 400 tickets deflected (40%)
- Remaining tickets: 600
- Average handling time: 10 minutes (33% faster)
- Daily cost: 600 * 0.167 * $30 = $3,000

**Savings:** $4,500/day = $1.35M/year

**RAG System Cost:** $200K setup + $100K/year operation

**ROI:** ($1.35M - $100K) / $200K = 6.25x (first year)
