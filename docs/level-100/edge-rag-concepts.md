## Overview

**Edge RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation at the Edge) combines the power of large language models with local data retrieval, running entirely on-premises or at the edge. This approach enables organizations to leverage generative AI capabilities while maintaining complete data sovereignty and control.

### What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI pattern that enhances large language model (LLM) responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers.

**Traditional LLM:**
```
User Question → LLM → Answer (based only on training data)
```

**RAG System:**
```
User Question → Retrieve Relevant Docs → LLM + Context → Enhanced Answer
```

### What is Edge RAG?

**Edge RAG** deploys this entire system on-premises or at the edge:
- Local LLM deployment
- Local document storage and indexing
- Local query processing
- No cloud dependency for sensitive data

**Key Benefits:**
- Complete data sovereignty
- Sub-second response times
- No internet dependency
- Privacy-preserving AI
- Compliance with data residency requirements
