## EU Data Boundary: Deep Dive

The EU Data Boundary is one of the most significant commitments for organizations with strict sovereignty requirements.

### What Is the EU Data Boundary?

A commitment to store and process customer data within the European Union, with clear documentation of any exceptions.

**Scope:**
- **Customer Data:** All data customers provide to Microsoft cloud services
- **Personal Data:** Data subject to GDPR
- **Service-Generated Data:** Data created during service operation

### How It Works

**Data Storage:**
- Primary storage in EU datacenters
- Backup and disaster recovery within EU
- No routine data transfers outside EU

**Data Processing:**
- Computation occurs in EU regions
- Service operations within EU
- Support scenarios controlled by customer

**Exceptions (Transparent and Documented):**

1. **Customer-Initiated Transfers:**
   - Customer explicitly configures data to leave EU
   - Example: Customer creates resource in non-EU region

2. **Support Scenarios:**
   - Customer Lockbox provides control
   - Support personnel access only with approval
   - Time-limited and logged access

3. **Specific Service Features:**
   - Global routing (Azure Front Door, Traffic Manager)
   - Threat intelligence (security services)
   - Service telemetry (can be disabled)

**Documentation and Transparency:**
- Published list of data flows
- Regular updates and communications
- Customer controls and options
- Audit logs and reporting

### Benefits for Customers

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- Simplifies GDPR compliance
- Supports Schrems II requirements
- Addresses data localization laws
- Reduces legal complexity

**Risk Reduction:**
- Minimizes cross-border data transfers
- Reduces exposure to foreign laws (e.g., CLOUD Act)
- Clear audit trail for compliance
- Transparent operations

**Business Confidence:**
- Predictable data handling
- Clear contractual commitments
- Microsoft's reputation and scale
- Continuous improvement and investment
