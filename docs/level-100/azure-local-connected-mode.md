## What is Connected Mode?

**Connected Mode** is the default and recommended deployment mode for Azure Local. In this mode, the cluster maintains regular connectivity to Microsoft Azure services, enabling hybrid cloud capabilities, centralized management, and cloud-based monitoring and backup services.

### Key Characteristics

**Connectivity:**
- Outbound HTTPS connectivity to Azure (no inbound required)
- Intermittent connectivity acceptable (not continuous 24/7)
- Resilient to temporary network outages (hours to days)
- Proxy server support for restricted networks

**Management:**
- Azure portal for cluster overview and management
- Azure Arc for unified hybrid management
- Windows Admin Center for detailed administration
- PowerShell for automation and scripting

**Integration:**
- Full access to Azure hybrid services
- Azure Backup for VM protection
- Azure Monitor for observability
- Azure Security Center for threat protection
- Azure Update Manager for patch management

## Prerequisites and Connectivity Requirements

### Network Requirements

**Minimum Bandwidth:**
- 1-5 Mbps per cluster for basic management
- 10-50 Mbps for monitoring with Azure Monitor
- 100+ Mbps for Azure Backup and Site Recovery

**Recommended Bandwidth:**
- 50-100 Mbps for typical deployments
- 500-1000 Mbps for large clusters with frequent backups
- Varies based on number of VMs and backup frequency

**Latency Tolerance:**
- Target: < 150ms to nearest Azure region
- Acceptable: < 250ms for management operations
- Higher latency impacts admin responsiveness, not VM performance

**Connectivity Type:**
- Direct internet connection (most common)
- Azure ExpressRoute (recommended for large deployments)
- VPN connection (acceptable, ensure sufficient bandwidth)
- Proxy server supported (explicit or transparent)

### Azure Subscription Requirements

**Subscription Type:**
- Any Azure subscription (Pay-as-you-go, Enterprise Agreement, CSP)
- Sufficient permissions to create resources
- Azure Local capacity available in subscription

**Required Permissions:**
- **Owner** or **Contributor** role on subscription or resource group
- Permission to register Azure resource providers
- Permission to create Azure Arc-enabled servers
- Azure AD permissions for service principal creation (or pre-created)

### Firewall and Endpoint Access

**Required Azure Endpoints:**

https://*.servicebus.windows.net (Event Hubs)
```

**Port Requirements:**
- Outbound TCP 443 (HTTPS) to all endpoints above
- No inbound connections from internet required
- DNS resolution to Azure public endpoints

**Proxy Configuration:**
- Set via PowerShell: `Set-AzStackHciNetwork -ProxyServer "http://proxy:8080"`
- Supports authenticated proxies
- Bypass local addresses

### Identity and Authentication

**Azure Active Directory:**
- Azure AD tenant required
- Service principal for Arc registration
- Managed identity for Azure services
- Azure AD Connect optional (for AD sync)

**Local Active Directory:**
- Domain-joined servers recommended
- RBAC for administrative access
- Group Policy support
- Certificate-based authentication optional

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Azure Local connects to Azure Arc
2. Azure Arc authenticates to Azure AD
3. Managed identity issued for cluster
4. Identity used for all Azure service access
5. Automatic token refresh (no credential storage)

## Real-Time Synchronization with Azure

### How Synchronization Works

Connected Mode maintains near real-time synchronization of metadata and telemetry:

**Sync Frequency:**
- **Heartbeat**: Every 5 minutes
- **Inventory**: Every 24 hours or on-demand
- **Metrics**: Every 1-5 minutes (configurable)
- **Logs**: Every 1-15 minutes (configurable)
- **Alerts**: Real-time (within seconds)

**What Gets Synchronized:**
- Cluster configuration and state
- Node inventory (CPU, memory, storage)
- VM inventory and properties
- Health and fault status
- Performance metrics (CPU, memory, storage, network)
- Event logs (security, system, application)
- Update status and compliance

**What Does NOT Get Synchronized:**
- VM data or application data
- Storage volume contents
- Network traffic payloads
- User files or databases
- Credentials or secrets

### Data Sovereignty in Connected Mode

**Important:** Even in Connected Mode, workload data stays on-premises:

**Data that Stays Local:**
- ✅ VM disks and file systems
- ✅ Storage volume contents
- ✅ Application databases
- ✅ User files and documents
- ✅ Network traffic between VMs
- ✅ Backup data (if backing up locally)

**Metadata Sent to Azure:**
- ⚠️ VM names, sizes, states
- ⚠️ Performance metrics (CPU %, memory %, etc.)
- ⚠️ Event log entries
- ⚠️ Configuration settings
- ⚠️ Fault and health status

**Compliance Considerations:**
- Metadata does not contain sensitive business data
- Meets most data residency requirements
- Configurable log filtering available
- Data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+)
