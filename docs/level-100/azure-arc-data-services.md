## Cost Considerations

**Total Cost of Ownership:**

**Arc Data Services:**

- Lower than self-managed on-premises (reduced admin)
- Flexible with BYOL

**Example Monthly Cost (SQL MI, 16 vCores):**

**Pay-as-you-go:**
- General Purpose: ~$4,600/month
- Business Critical: ~$11,500/month

**With Azure Hybrid Benefit:**
- General Purpose: ~$2,100/month
- Business Critical: ~$5,200/month

**Break-Even vs. Azure SQL Database:**
- Typically 6-12 months for sustained workloads
- Faster for 24/7 production databases
