## What is Sovereign Public Cloud?

**Sovereign Public Cloud** represents Microsoft's approach to delivering cloud services with enhanced sovereignty controls while maintaining the full benefits of public cloud infrastructure. It combines the **scalability, innovation, and cost-efficiency** of Azure public cloud with **data residency guarantees, operational transparency, and compliance automation** required for sovereign workloads.

### Core Concept

Unlike traditional public cloud where resources are shared with minimal control over data location and access, Sovereign Public Cloud provides:

- **Enhanced Data Controls:** Granular control over data location, processing, and access
- **Compliance Automation:** Policy-driven guardrails that enforce sovereignty requirements
- **Operational Transparency:** Clear visibility into who can access data and under what circumstances
- **Customer Lockbox:** Customer approval required for Microsoft support access
- **Confidential Computing:** Hardware-based encryption for data in use

**Key Principle:** "Sovereignty controls in the cloud, not sovereignty without the cloud"

## Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty

Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is the primary solution for implementing Sovereign Public Cloud. It provides a **policy-driven framework** that enables organizations to meet sovereignty requirements while leveraging Azure's global infrastructure.

### What is Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty?

**Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty** is a set of capabilities, policies, and configurations built on top of Azure that:

1. **Enforces Data Residency:** Ensures data stays in specified regions
2. **Implements Access Controls:** Restricts who can access customer data
3. **Provides Transparency:** Logs and audits all access and operations
4. **Automates Compliance:** Continuously monitors and remediates policy violations
5. **Enables Confidentiality:** Protects data with hardware-based encryption

**Official Definition from Microsoft:**
> "Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is a solution that provides sovereignty controls and capabilities to help organizations meet their specific sovereignty, compliance, security, and policy requirements on the Microsoft Cloud." - [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereign-cloud/)

## Key Capabilities and Features

### 1. Data Residency and Boundary Controls

**Data Residency Guarantees:**
- Customer data stored in specified Azure regions
- Data processing occurs within defined boundaries
- Backup and replication respect geographic constraints
- Metadata residency controls available

**EU Data Boundary Implementation:**
- Customer data and metadata stay within EU/EEA
- Documented exceptions with customer control
- Applies to Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power Platform
- Ongoing expansion of boundary coverage

**Implementation:**
```
Azure Policy → Deny resource creation outside allowed regions
Azure Monitor → Alert on data transfer outside boundaries
Azure Policy → Audit compliance continuously
Customer Lockbox → Control exceptions to data boundary
```

### 2. Customer Lockbox

**What is Customer Lockbox?**

Customer Lockbox provides **customer approval** for Microsoft support engineers to access customer data. Without explicit approval, Microsoft cannot access customer content.

**How It Works:**
1. Microsoft support engineer needs access to customer data
2. Engineer initiates Customer Lockbox request
3. Customer receives notification and request details
4. Customer reviews request and approves or denies
5. Access is granted only if approved, and all access is logged
6. Access automatically expires after specified duration

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Customer control over support access
- ✅ Audit trail of all access requests and approvals
- ✅ Time-limited access with automatic expiration
- ✅ Integration with Azure AD for approver management

**Use Cases:**
- Regulatory requirements for data access approval
- High-security environments (financial, healthcare, government)
- Demonstrating control to auditors and customers
- Meeting contractual obligations for data access

**[Official Documentation: Customer Lockbox for Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/customer-lockbox-overview)**

---

### 3. Azure Policy for Compliance Automation

**Policy-Driven Sovereignty:**

Azure Policy enables organizations to **enforce sovereignty requirements automatically** rather than relying on manual processes or trust.

**Key Policy Capabilities:**

**Deny Policies:** Prevent non-compliant configurations
- Deny resource creation in non-allowed regions
- Deny public endpoint exposure
- Deny data export to non-compliant destinations

**Audit Policies:** Monitor compliance status
- Report on resource locations
- Track policy violations
- Generate compliance reports for auditors

**DeployIfNotExists Policies:** Auto-remediate violations
- Automatically enable encryption
- Deploy monitoring agents
- Configure diagnostic settings

**Example Sovereignty Policies:**

```json
// Deny resource creation outside EU regions
{
  "mode": "All",
  "policyRule": {
    "if": {
      "not": {
        "field": "location",
        "in": [
          "westeurope",
          "northeurope",
          "francecentral",
          "germanywestcentral",
          "swedencentral"
        ]
      }
    },
    "then": {
      "effect": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

**Built-in Policy Initiatives for Sovereignty:**
- Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty Baseline
- EU Data Boundary Policy Set
- Industry-specific compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)
- Regional regulatory frameworks

**[Official Documentation: Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview)**

## Implementation Best Practices

### Planning and Design Phase

**1. Data Discovery and Classification**

Before implementing Sovereign Public Cloud, understand what data you have:

✅ **Identify all data types:**
- Customer data (PII, financial, health)
- System data (logs, metrics, diagnostic)
- Organizational data (HR, financial, operational)

✅ **Classify by sensitivity:**
- Public (no controls needed)
- Internal (standard controls)
- Confidential (enhanced controls)
- Restricted (maximum controls)

✅ **Map data flows:**
- Where is data created?
- Where is data stored?
- Where is data processed?
- Where is data archived or deleted?

**Tool:** [Microsoft Purview Data Map](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/concept-data-map) for automated data discovery

---

**2. Define Sovereignty Requirements**

Document clear sovereignty requirements:

✅ **Regulatory requirements:**
- Which regulations apply? (GDPR, HIPAA, sector-specific)
- What are data residency requirements?
- What compliance certifications are needed?

✅ **Operational requirements:**
- Where can data be stored?
- Where can data be processed?
- Who can access data?
- What audit and logging is required?

✅ **Technical requirements:**
- What encryption is required?
- What key management approach?
- What network isolation is needed?

**Output:** Sovereignty Requirements Document (SRD) that guides all implementation decisions

---

**3. Design Landing Zones**

Implement [Azure Landing Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) with sovereignty controls:

✅ **Management Groups hierarchy:**
```
Root Management Group

│   ├── Production (MG) ← Strict policies
│   ├── Development (MG) ← Relaxed policies
│   └── Sandbox (MG) ← Testing policies
└── Non-Sovereign Workloads (MG)
```

✅ **Subscription design:**
- Separate subscriptions by sovereignty level
- Separate subscriptions by environment (prod/dev/test)
- Separate subscriptions by workload type

✅ **Network topology:**
- Hub-and-spoke with Azure Firewall
- Private Link for PaaS services
- ExpressRoute for hybrid connectivity
