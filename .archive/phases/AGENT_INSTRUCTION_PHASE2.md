## Your Mission

Create a single file with detailed design briefs for 20 visual assets so professional designers can build production SVGs.

**File to Create:** `docs/level-200/VISUAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md`  
**Time Budget:** 1-2 hours  
**Assets to Specify:** 20 (Assets 21-40, organized by 6 modules)

## How to Get Started

### 1. Read These First (25 minutes total)

**Primary Reference:** `.github/VISUAL_ASSET_PROCESS.md`
- Read ONLY the **Step #1 section** (approximately lines 500-750)
- Contains full instructions, template, and quality checklist
- Shows what a detailed spec should look like

**Reference:** `docs/assets/images/README.md`
- Go to "LEVEL 200 - INTERMEDIATE: VISUAL ASSETS"
- See the 20 brief specs you'll expand (Assets 21-40)
- Use these as input material

### 2. Understand What You're Creating (5 minutes)

Take this brief spec:
```
#### Asset 21: Advanced Networking Architecture
**File:** `level-200/azure-local-advanced-networking.svg`
**Priority:** High
**Description:** Detailed networking architecture showing SET configuration, 
VLAN organization, RDMA optimization, and network topology...
**Content:** [bullets]
**Visual Elements:** [bullets]
```

And expand it into a detailed brief like this:
```
### Asset 21: Advanced Networking Architecture

**Context:** (2-3 paragraphs explaining why this matters to learners)

**Design Constraints:** (what technical/style limitations apply)

**Content Requirements:** (specific elements to show, bulleted)

**Visual Elements:** (colors, icons, layout specifics)

**Wireframe Guidance:** (sketch or layout description)

**Acceptance Criteria:** (7-10 specific, testable checkpoints)

**Microsoft Learn Adaptation:** (how to adapt from official sources)
```
