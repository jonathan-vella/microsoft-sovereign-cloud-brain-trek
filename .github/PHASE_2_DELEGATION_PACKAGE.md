## üéØ Task: Create Detailed Visual Specifications

### What You Need to Do

Expand each of the 20 Level 200 visual asset specifications from brief 3-4 line descriptions into **detailed design briefs** that give a professional designer everything they need to create the SVG file.

### Input: Current Brief Specs

Located in: `docs/assets/images/README.md` (Level 200 section, Assets 21-40)

Example current brief (Asset 21):
```
#### Asset 21: Advanced Networking Architecture
**File:** `level-200/azure-local-advanced-networking.svg`  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** üî¥ Needed
**Description:** Detailed networking architecture showing SET configuration, 
VLAN organization, RDMA optimization, and network topology for enterprise 
Azure Local deployments.
**Content:** [bullet list of content elements]
**Visual Elements:** [design guidance]
**Size:** 1400x1000px
**Used In:** [files that reference this]
**Source Refs:** [Microsoft Learn links]
```

### Output: Detailed Design Brief

Your output file: `docs/level-200/VISUAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md`

Example detailed specification (what you'll create):
```
### Asset 21: Advanced Networking Architecture

**Context:**
This diagram is critical for enterprise architects implementing Azure Local 
in high-performance environments. It demonstrates how to configure network 
adapters for optimal data flow, separate management traffic, and enable RDMA 
acceleration. This is the most technically complex networking topic in Level 200.

**Design Constraints:**
- Must clearly distinguish 4 network types (management, storage, cluster, RDMA)
- RDMA paths must be visually distinct (different color or pattern)
- Enterprise customers expect similar style to Azure documentation
- Must fit 1400x1000px canvas with 50px margins
- Color palette from Microsoft brand guidelines

**Content Requirements:**
- Physical server with 6-8 network adapter slots
- Virtual switch configuration showing teaming
- VLAN assignments color-coded
- RDMA optimization layer overlay
- Redundancy paths (dual switches, failover indicators)
- Bandwidth allocation indicators (percentages)
- Network adapter type labels (Intel/AMD specific)

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Light gray grid (network topology style)
- Network adapters: Use Microsoft icon style (small 16x16 icons)
- VLANs: Color-coded (Blue=Management, Orange=Storage, Green=Cluster, Purple=RDMA)
- Arrows: Solid for active paths, dashed for failover
- Typography: Segoe UI, 12pt for labels, 14pt for section headers

**Wireframe Guidance:**
Top section: Physical server with adapter slots
Middle section: Virtual switch with VLAN configuration
Bottom section: Network flow diagram showing data paths
Right side: Legend with color meanings and adapter specifications

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Shows 6-8 physical network adapter slots clearly labeled
- [ ] Virtual switch configuration visible with SET teams
- [ ] VLAN colors distinct and match color palette
- [ ] RDMA paths visually separated from standard network
- [ ] Redundancy (dual switches/failover) indicated
- [ ] Performance metrics included (bandwidth, latency)
- [ ] No crossed lines in network diagram
- [ ] Text labels readable at 100% zoom
- [ ] Diagram fits 1400x1000px with proper margins
- [ ] Accessible to colorblind users (patterns + colors)

**Microsoft Learn Adaptation:**
Base reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/concepts/networking
Adapt the SET configuration diagram from Microsoft's networking documentation.
Show similar style but expanded to include RDMA overlay and VLAN details.
Must align with Azure Local documentation graphics style.
```
